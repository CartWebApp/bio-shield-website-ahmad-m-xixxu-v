Analysis process:


Ahmad: It began with a planning session with my teammate to outline the project. We agreed to include the following pages: Home, Products, About Us, Contact Us, Cart, and Sign-Up. We divided responsibilities: I would develop the entire website—including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—while my teammate was responsible for gathering and organizing the text, images, and other content for each page.

With our roles clearly defined, I mapped out my coding strategy. First, I created a main directory containing all the HTML files. Inside it, I added two subfolders: one for CSS stylesheets and another for JavaScript scripts. This structure ensured the project was clean, organized, and easy for any developer to navigate.

I began by coding the HTML pages. Thanks to my prior experience in web development, I completed them in three days with minimal AI assistance. Next, I tackled the CSS files, assigning a dedicated stylesheet to each HTML page for clarity and maintainability. Since I was less familiar with CSS, I frequently relied on AI to troubleshoot issues and enhance my code. I completed the styling phase in another three days.

Finally, I focused on the JavaScript functionality, implementing features for the cart, sign-in, and search bar. JavaScript was the most challenging part of the project, so I leaned heavily on AI support to overcome obstacles and refine my logic.

After completing all coding tasks, I thoroughly tested the website to ensure it was fully functional. One key takeaway from this project was learning to use AI as a collaborative tool—not as a shortcut, but as a resource to guide and improve my work.
